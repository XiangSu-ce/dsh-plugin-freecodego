# Skill installation and freshness

Read this reference when installing or updating skills, diagnosing unexpected workflow behavior, or running HyperFrames setup in CI.

HyperFrames installs the core set eagerly and workflow skills lazily.

- **Core set:** `/hyperframes`, the `hyperframes-*` domain skills, and `/media-use`.
- **Workflow skills:** installed when routing selects them through `this pack is bundled offline and is not updated at runtime <workflow-name>`.

## What `init` does

Create the project directory and its composition file directly; this pack needs no scaffolding step.

The `--skip-skills` CLI flag is temporarily ignored. CI and tests may opt out with `HYPERFRAMES_SKIP_SKILLS=1`.

## Diagnose and update

```bash
this pack is bundled offline and is not updated at runtime
this pack is bundled offline and is not updated at runtime <workflow-name>
```

- `skills check` exits non-zero when an installed skill is stale or the core set is incomplete. Workflows available on demand but not installed are not failures.
- Bare `skills update` refreshes the core set and everything already installed, prunes unpublished skills, and does not expand the workflow set.
- Named `skills update <name...>` also installs those named workflows or domain skills.
- Bare `skills` installs the full published set explicitly.

If the HyperFrames CLI is unavailable, use `npx skills add heygen-com/hyperframes --skill <workflow-name>` for one workflow or `npx skills add heygen-com/hyperframes --all` for the full published set.

The CLI may print a one-line stale-skill reminder during `render`, `lint`, or `check`. Treat a failed update as a visible tool failure; do not continue from a remembered workflow contract.
